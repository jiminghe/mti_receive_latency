sudo apt upgrade
```

### Step 2: Install Boost Libraries
Boost is available in the default Ubuntu repositories, so you can install it using `apt`.

sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
```

### Step 3: Install Build Essentials
You need `build-essential` for compiling your C++ code.

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Step 4: Verify Boost Installation
To verify that Boost is installed correctly, you can check the version using:

```sh
dpkg -s libboost-all-dev | grep 'Version'
```
